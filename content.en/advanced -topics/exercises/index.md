Exercises## Exercises

**25.9** Will functional dependencies be preserved if a relation is converted to a temporal relation by adding a time attribute? How is the problem handled in a temporal database?

**25.10** Consider two-dimensional vector data where the data items do not over- lap. Is it possible to convert such vector data to raster data? If so, what are the drawbacks of storing raster data obtained by such conversion, instead of the original vector data?

**25.11** Study the support for spatial data offered by the database system that you use, and implement the following:

a. A schema to represent the geographic location of restaurants along with features such as the cuisine served at the restaurant and the level of expensiveness.

b. A query to find moderately priced restaurants that serve Indian food and are within 5 miles of your house (assume any location for your house).

c. A query to find for each restaurant the distance from the nearest restaurant serving the same cuisine and with the same level of ex- pensiveness.

**25.12** What problems can occur in a continuous-media system if data are deliv- ered either too slowly or too fast?

**25.13** List three main features of mobile computing over wireless networks that are distinct from traditional distributed systems.

**25.14** List three factors that need to be considered in query optimization for mobile computing that are not considered in traditional query optimizers.

**25.15** Give an example to show that the version-vector scheme does not ensure serializability. (Hint: Use the example from Practice Exercise 25.8, with the assumption that documents 1 and 2 are available on both mobile computers A and B, and take into account the possibility that a document may be read without being updated.)
