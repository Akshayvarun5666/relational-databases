# DATA WAREHOUSING, DATA MINING, AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL

Database queries are often designed to extract specific information, such as the balance of an account or the sum of a customerâ€™s account balances. However, queries designed to help formulate a corporate strategy usually requires access to large amounts of data originating at multiple sources.

A data warehouse is a repository of data gathered from multiple sources and stored under a common, unified database schema. Data stored in warehouse are analyzed by a variety of complex aggregations and statistical analyses, often ex- ploiting SQL constructs for data analysis which we saw in Chapter 5. Furthermore, knowledge-discovery techniques may be used to attempt to discover rules and patterns from the data. For example, a retailer may discover that certain products tend to be purchased together, and may use that information to develop mar- keting strategies. This process of knowledge discovery from data is called _data mining_. Chapter 20 addresses the issues of data warehousing and data mining.

In our discussions so far, we have focused on relatively simple, well-structured data. However, there is an enormous amount of unstructured textual data on the Internet, on intranets within organizations, and on the computers of individual users. Users wish to find relevant information from this vast body of mostly tex- tual information, using simple query mechanisms such as keyword queries. The field of information retrieval deals with querying of such unstructured data, and pays particular attention to the ranking of query results. Although this area of research is several decades old, it has undergone tremendous growth with the development of the World Wide Web. Chapter 21 provides an introduction to the field of information retrieval.

# Data Warehousing and Mining

Businesses have begun to exploit the burgeoning data online to make better decisions about their activities, such as what items to stock and how best to target customers to increase sales. There are two aspects to exploiting such data. The first aspect is to gather data from multiple sources into a central repository, called a data warehouse. Issues involved in warehousing include techniques for dealing with dirty data, that is, data with some errors, and with techniques for efficient storage and indexing of large volumes of data.

The second aspect is to analyze the gathered data to find information or knowledge that can be the basis for business decisions. Some kinds of data anal- ysis can be done by using SQL constructs for online analytical processing (OLAP), which we saw in Section 5.6 (Chapter 5), and by using tools and graphical in- terfaces for OLAP. Another approach to getting knowledge from data is to use _data mining_, which aims at detecting various types of patterns in large volumes of data. Data mining supplements various types of statistical techniques with similar goals.
