9.5 Rapid Application Development## 9.5 Rapid Application Development

If Web applications are built without using tools or libraries for constructing the user interface, the programming effort required to construct the user interface can be significantly more than that required for business logic and database access. Several approaches have been developed to reduce the effort required to build applications:

• Provide a library of functions to generate user-interface elements with mini- mal programming.

• Provide drag-and-drop features in an integrated development environment that allows user-interface elements to be dragged from a menu into a design view of a page. The integrated development environment generates code that creates the user-interface element by invoking library functions.

• Automatically generate code for the user interface from a declarative specifi- cation.

All these approaches have been used for creating user interfaces, well before the Web was created, as part of **Rapid Application Development** (**RAD**) tools, and are now used extensively for creating Web applications as well.

Examples of tools designed for rapid development of interfaces for database applications include Oracle Forms, Sybase PowerBuilder, and Oracle Application Express (APEX). In addition, tools designed for Web application development, such as Visual Studio and Netbeans VisualWeb, support several features designed for rapid development of Web interfaces for database backed applications.

We study tools for construction of user interfaces in Section 9.5.1, and study frameworks that support automatic code generation from a system model, in Section 9.5.2.
