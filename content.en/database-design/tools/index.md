Tools## Tools

Many database systems provide tools for database design that support E-R dia- grams. These tools help a designer create E-Rdiagrams, and they can automatically create corresponding tables in a database. See bibliographic notes of Chapter 1 for references to database-system vendors’ Web sites.

There are also several database-independent data modeling tools that sup- port E-R diagrams and UML class diagrams. The drawing tool Dia, which is available as freeware, supports E-R diagrams and UML class diagrams. Com- mercial tools include IBM Rational Rose (www.ibm.com/software/rational), Microsoft Visio (see www.microsoft.com/office/visio), CA’s ERwin (www.ca.com/us/data- modeling.aspx), Poseidon for UML (www.gentleware.com), and SmartDraw (www.smartdraw.com).

## Tools

Development of a Web application requires several software tools such as an application server, a compiler, and an editor for a programming language such as Java or C#, and other optional tools such as a Web server. There are several integrated development environments that provide support for Web application development. The two most popular open-source IDEs are Eclipse, developed by IBM, and Netbeans, developed by Sun Microsystems. Microsoft’s Visual Studio is the most widely used IDE in the Windows world.

The Apache Tomcat (jakarta.apache.org), Glassfish (glassfish.dev.java.net), JBoss (jboss.org), and Caucho’s Resin (www.caucho.com), are application servers that sup- port servlets and JSP. The Apache Web server (apache.org) is the most widely used Web server today. Microsoft’s IIS (Internet Information Services) is a Web and ap- plication server that is widely used on Microsoft Windows platforms, supporting Microsoft’s ASP.NET (msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/).

IBM’s WebSphere (www.software.ibm.com) software provides a variety of soft- ware tools for Web application development and deployment, including an ap- plication server, an IDE, application integration middleware, business process management software and system management tools.

Some of the above tools are open-source software that can be used free of cost, some are free for noncommercial use or for personal use, while others need to be paid for. See the respective Web sites for more information.

The Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) JavaScript library (developer.yahoo.com/yui) is widely used for creating JavaScript programs that work across multiple browsers.
