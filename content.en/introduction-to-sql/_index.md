# Introduction to SQl

There are a number of database query languages in use, either commercially or experimentally. In this chapter, as well as in Chapters 4 and 5, we study the most widely used query language, SQL.

Although we refer to the SQL language as a “query language,” it can domuch more than just query a database. It can define the structure of the data, modify data in the database, and specify security constraints. 

It is not our intention to provide a complete users’ guide for SQL. Rather,we present SQL’s fundamental constructs and concepts. Individual implementations of SQL may differ in details, or may support only a subset of the full language.
