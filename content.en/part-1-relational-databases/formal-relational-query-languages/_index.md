# Formal Relational Query Languages

In Chapters 2 through 5 we introduced the relational model and covered SQL in great detail. In this chapter we present the formal model upon which SQL as well as other relational query languages are based.

We cover three formal languages.We start by presenting the relational algebra, which forms the basis of the widely used SQL query language.We then cover the tuple relational calculus and the domain relational calculus, which are declarative query languages based on mathematical logic.
