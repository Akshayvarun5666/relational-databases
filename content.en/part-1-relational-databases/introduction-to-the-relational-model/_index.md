# Introduction to the Relational Model

The relational model is today the primary data model for commercial dataprocessing applications. It attained its primary position because of its simplicity, which eases the job of the programmer, compared to earlier data models such as the network model or the hierarchical model.

In this chapter, we first study the fundamentals of the relational model. A substantial theory exists for relational databases. We study the part of this theory dealing with queries in Chapter 6. In Chapters 7 through 8, we shall examine aspects of database theory that help in the design of relational database schemas, while in Chapters 12 and 13 we discuss aspects of the theory dealing with efficient processing of queries.
