A number of relational database systems are available commercially, including IBM DB2, IBM Informix, Oracle, Sybase, and Microsoft SQL Server. In addition several database systems can be downloaded and used free of charge, including PostgreSQL, MySQL (free except for certain kinds of commercial use), and Oracle Express edition.

Most database systems provide a command line interface for submitting SQL commands. In addition, most databases also provide graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which simplify the task of browsing the database, creating and submitting queries, and administering the database. Commercial IDEs for SQLthat work across multiple database platforms, include Embarcadero’s RAD Studio and Aqua Data Studio.

For PostgreSQL, the pgAdmin tool provides GUI functionality, while for MySQL, phpMyAdmin provides GUI functionality. The NetBeans IDE provides a GUI front end that works with a number of different databases, but with limited functionality, while the Eclipse IDE supports similar functionality through several different plugins such as the Data Tools Platform (DTP) and JBuilder.

The SQL constructs discussed in this chapter are part of the SQL standard, but certain features are not supported by some databases. The Web site lists these incom- patibilities, which you will need to take into account when executing queries on those databases.

Most database vendors provide OLAP tools as part of their database systems, or as add-on applications. These include OLAP tools from Microsoft Corp., Oracle Express, and Informix Metacube. Tools may be integrated with a larger “business intelligence” product such as IBM Cognos. Many companies also provide analysis tools for specific applications, such as customer relationship management (for example, Oracle Siebel CRM).
