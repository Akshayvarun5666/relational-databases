Network Types## Network Types

Distributed databases and clientâ€“server systems are built around communica- tion networks. There are basically two types of networks: **local-area networks** and **wide-area networks**. The main difference between the two is the way in which they are distributed geographically. In local-area networks, processors are distributed over small geographical areas, such as a single building or a number of adjacent buildings. In wide-area networks, on the other hand, a number of autonomous processors are distributed over a large geographical area (such as the United States or the entire world). These differences imply major variations in the speed and reliability of the communication network, and are reflected in the distributed operating-system design.

### Local-Area Networks

**Local-area networks** (**LANs**) (Figure 17.10) emerged in the early 1970s as a way for computers to communicate and to share data with one another. People recognized that, for many enterprises, numerous small computers, each with its own self- contained applications, are more economical than a single large system. Because each small computer is likely to need access to a full complement of peripheral devices (such as disks and printers), and because some form of data sharing is likely to occur in a single enterprise, it was a natural step to connect these small systems into a network.

LANs are generally used in an office environment. All the sites in such systems are close to one another, so the communication links tend to have a higher speed and lower error rate than do their counterparts in wide-area networks. The most common links in a local-area network are twisted pair, coaxial cable, fiber optics, and wireless connections. Communication speeds range from tens of megabits per second (for wireless local-area networks), to 1 gigabit per second for Gigabit Ethernet. The most recent Ethernet standard is 10-gigabit Ethernet.

A **storage-area network** (**SAN**) is a special type of high-speed local-area net- work designed to connect large banks of storage devices (disks) to computers that use the data (see Figure 17.11).

Thus storage-area networks help build large-scale _shared-disk systems_. The motivation for using storage-area networks to connect multiple computers to large banks of storage devices is essentially the same as that for shared-disk databases, namely:

- Scalability by adding more computers.

- High availability, since data are still accessible even if a computer fails.

RAID organizations are used in the storage devices to ensure high availability of the data, permitting processing to continue even if individual disks fail. Storage- area networks are usually built with redundancy, such as multiple paths between nodes, so if a component such as a link or a connection to the network fails, the network continues to function.

### Wide-Area Networks

**Wide-area networks** (**WANs**) emerged in the late 1960s, mainly as an academic research project to provide efficient communication among sites, allowing hardware and software to be shared conveniently and economically by a wide community of users. Systems that allowed remote terminals to be connected to a central computer via telephone lines were developed in the early 1960s, but they were not true WANs. The first WAN to be designed and developed was the _Arpanet_. Work on the Arpanet began in 1968. The Arpanet has grown from a four-site experimental network to a worldwide network of networks, the **Internet**, comprising hundreds of millions of computer systems. Typical links on the Internet are fiber-optic lines and, sometimes, satellite channels. Data rates for wide-area links typically range from a few megabits per second to hundreds of gigabits per second. The last link, to end user sites, has traditionally been the slowest link, using such technologies as _digital subscriber line_ (DSL) technology (supporting a few megabits per second) or dial-up modem connections over land-based telephone lines (supporting up to 56 kilobits per second). Today, the last link is typically a cable modem or fiber optic connection (each supporting tens of megabits per second), or a wireless connection supporting several megabits per second.

In addition to limits on data rates, communication in a WAN must also contend with significant **latency**: a message may take up to a few hundred milliseconds to be delivered across the world, both due to speed of light delays, and due to queuing delays at a number of routers in the path of the message. Applications whose data and computing resources are distributed geographically have to be carefully designed to ensure latency does not affect system performance excessively.

WANs can be classified into **two types:**

- In **discontinuous connection** WANs, such as those based on mobile wireless connections, hosts are connected to the network only part of the time.

- In **continuous connection** WANs, such as the wired Internet, hosts are connected to the network at all times.

Networks that are not continuously connected typically do not allow transactions across sites, but may keep local copies of remote data, and refresh the copies periodically (every night, for instance). For applications where consistency is not critical, such as sharing of documents, groupware systems such as Lotus Notes allow updates of remote data to be made locally, and the updates are then propagated back to the remote site periodically. There is a potential for conflicting updates at different sites, conflicts that have to be detected and resolved. A mechanism for detecting conflicting updates is described later, in Section 25.5.4; the resolution mechanism for conflicting updates is, however, application dependent.
